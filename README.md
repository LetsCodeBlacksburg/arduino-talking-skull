# arduino-talking-skull
This project is designed as a make-and-take Halloween workshop that requires:
* 6 inch plastic Halloween skull with freely articulated jaw (Walmart or Target for under $5)
* Arduino UNO (recommend the red "Funduino" board with built in servo/I/O 3pin headers)
* Ultrasonic ping rnage finder (either US-100 or HC-SR04 sendors)
* DFPlayer mini MP3 player (my DFRobot.com)
* Small 3watt 8ohm speaker
* Two 1k ohm resistors
* Interconnecting MM/MF/FF wires (if no breadboard)

Reference the PDF build doc on how to connect everthing. Use the LCBB_servo-test code to first
test your servo/skull values before continuing with the build.
